# Remarks

This document contains important notes and reflections about our project.

## General Remarks

- **API Availability:** It would have been beneficial to have a real API dummy for testing purposes. I started creating my own, but realized it was beyond the scope of this project.

- **Testing Framework:** This was my first experience with Cypress. It appears to be a promising tool for end-to-end testing.

- **Unit Testing:** Due to time constraints, I was unable to add unit tests with `jest`.

- **Quasar Framework:** As a first-time Quasar user, I found it to be a robust and comprehensive framework. However, I found their implementation of CSS helpers, similar to `Tailwind`, to be subpar. It would be more efficient to use Tailwind directly.(or a `BEM` implenation in scss)

- **services** In real world project I would use `axios` and not Fetcth for better error handling.

## Future Considerations

- **Unit Testing:** For future improvements, I would consider adding Jest for unit testing. Jest provides a full suite of testing tools and has great integration with Vue.js.

- **CSS Framework:** I would consider using Tailwind CSS on top of Quasar for more efficient and intuitive styling.

- **Design Process:** I would create a wireframe first in Figma, and implement it after evaluation. This would ensure a more streamlined development process and a more cohesive user interface.

## Overall, a fun experience and great to learn a new framework that plays nicely. ðŸ˜ƒ
